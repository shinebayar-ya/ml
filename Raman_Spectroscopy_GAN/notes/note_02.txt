# Raman Spectroscopy | Quantum theory of Raman effect | Stokes and anti-Stokes line (YT video draft)

When monochromatic light reflected into matter, some of light scattered.
Break down the scattering lights:
- Rayleigh scattering (the most part)
- Raman scattering (the small part)

Rayleigh scattering freq = incident light freq
Raman scattering freq = incident light freq + diff

Spectroscopy is study of interactions between light and matter.

Raman spectroscopy is study of spectral that based on Raman effect.

Raman effect is based on molecules vibrational, rotational modes.

How to gain or loss energy?

elastic collision is no gain or loss of energy by molecule. (Rayleigh scattering)
(freq scattering) f_s = f_i (freq incident)

inelastic collision is exchanged energy between molecule & incident radiation.
Related to Raman scattering
f_s != f_i
E` != E

Stokes shift vs Anti-Stokes shift
Y_s < Y_i vs Y_s > Y_i
dE > 0 vs dE < 0

energy is gain or loss related to vibrational energy level

intensity depends on the population of the energy levels.
